How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helps to locate lines when changes occured, but apart from that, locating bug
is manual process. Highlighting changed part in line would further help.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It makes easier to undo changes and try different approaches.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

Commit does not mean "save" - it means more "portion of work finished".
Automatic saves are needed to prevent loss of progress, but they do not indicate
finisheness.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

If work in progress requires making changes in multiple files, saving them all
in one commit allows easier tracking of changes.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

By typing them. 


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Version control and history enable to restore previous working version.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Sample project.
