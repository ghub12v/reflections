What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Hidden directory is created. Later, commits will be stored in it.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains only files in working directory, that will be commited to repository. Irrelevant files are excluded this way.
