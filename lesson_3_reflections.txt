local?

Remote repository is useful as a backup, and for collaboration with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git

If both repositories are updated, there will be conflict, that might need
to be resolved manually. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork - GitHub specific repository clone, enables collaboration between
different authors.
Clone - full copy of repository. Useful as backup or when start working with
existing (someone else's) project.
Branch - used to contain possibly dusruptive changes from main (and supposedly working) part of code.
